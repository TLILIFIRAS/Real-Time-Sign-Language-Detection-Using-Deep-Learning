# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project demonstrates a Sign Language Detection system that utilizes Action Recognition with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Deep Learning model. The system leverages MediaPipe's Holistic Keypoints to extract skeletal data from video sequences, which is then used to predict sign language gestures.
